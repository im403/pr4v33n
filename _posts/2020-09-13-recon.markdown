## The Myth

* When we have a full scope target everyone will perform subdomain enumeration this is the place where we are differentiating us from other bug bounty hunters for easy win.

* There are two kinds of Bug Bounty Hunters. One will deep dive into the application logic to find bugs, the other one will find easy bugs by digging into the assets.

## In-scope

* Different ways to collect subdomains *yet simple but powerfull*

## Methods used to collect subdomains for a target

* Scraping

* Bruteforcing

## Scraping

* Scraping subdomains using open source information gathering

* Amass - Amass has the capability to scrape data across 48 sources like Shodan, Virustotal, Censys, Github, Facebook CT and much more for more information you can just run command `amass enum -list`

* Scraping subdomains using Amass just run a command `amass enum -passive -d example.com -config config.ini -o example_passive.txt` 

* config.ini file helps us with more valuable subdomains yet useful. We should specify API Keys for specific data sources. Take a look at [Amass Project](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass/blob/master/examples/config.ini)
